# theLolStats



<p>This is a simple league of legends stat website. Type in your username and it will display your solo/duo rank, amount of wins this season, and mastery points for every champion you've played. I've built this entirely by myself.</p>

<h2>Highlights:</h2>
  1. League Of Legends is a game that is constantly being updated and as a result the data changes a lot to. To counteract this I built functions using async/await   to not load the page before getting the most updated data first.

  2. Promise based GET requests to the League Of Legends API
